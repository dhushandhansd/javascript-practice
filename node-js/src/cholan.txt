Rajaraja I, born Arulmoli Varman,[1][2][3] often described as Rajaraja the Great, was a Chola emperor (reigned c. 985â€“1014) and was the most powerful king in south at his time chiefly remembered for reinstating the Chola power and ensuring its supremacy in south India and Indian Ocean.[4][5]

His extensive empire included the Pandya country (southern Tamil Nadu), the Chera country (central Kerala and western Tamil Nadu) and northern Sri Lanka. He also acquired the Lakshadweep and Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean. Campaigns against the Western Gangas (southern Karnataka) and Chalukyas extended the Chola influence as far as the Tungabhadra River. On the eastern coast he battled with the Chalukyas for the possession of Vengi (the Godavari districts).[6][7][8][9]

Rajaraja, an able administrator, also built the great Brihadisvara Temple at the Chola capital Thanjavur.[10] The temple is regarded as the foremost of all temples in the medieval south Indian architectural style. During his reign, the texts of the Tamil poets Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar were collected and edited into one compilation called Thirumurai.[7][11] He initiated a massive project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganisation of the country into individual units known as valanadus.[12][13] Rajaraja died in 1014 CE and was succeeded by his son Rajendra Chola I.
